# Analysis-of-appointments-turn-up

## Introduction
In this project we will be carrying analysis related to the turn up event of patients to their appointment across different neighborhood in Brasil. We will be answering related question that would be raised after taking an overview of the dataset in order to give us insights as to why patients may or may not show up for their appoinment. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this secction I got answers to questions like;

- What is the percentage of patients that show up to those who do not show up?
- Does age have an effect on predicting the turn up?
- Does time interval of the scheduled date and appointment date influence the turn up?
- Do patient with scholarship tend to show up more?
- Do patient with illness/Disability tend to show up more?
- Does neighborhood have an impact on the turnup?
- Does sending SMS alert help patients show up more?
- Do Alcoholic patient show up more?

## Conclusion
From the investigation, we could draw some conclusions like, people above 40 tend to show up more than the younger patients. This could be due to the fact that the higher percent of ill/disabled are among them, which we can conclude from our analysis that disabled/ill patients turn up more and as we know, hypothetically people tend to be more non chalant with health when they feel okay. Patients who turned up have lower percent of scholarship granted to them. Also, patients who received SMS alert have a lower turn up than those who did not receive, but in the real sense it should be the other way round. Some locations show more turn up of patients than others. Based on the analysis, the farther away the appointment is fixed from the day it is scheduled, the lesser the chances of them turning up. This could be as a result of them forgetting or them feeling better and thereby thinking there is no need turning up.

This project was done as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.
