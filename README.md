# Analysis-of-appointments-turn-up
In this project we will be carrying analysis related to the turn up event of patients to their appointment across different neighborhood in Brasil. We will be answering related question that would be raised after taking an overview of the dataset in order to give us insights as to why patients may or may not show up for their appoinment. We will start by importing required modules and the dataset that would be used in this analysis.
